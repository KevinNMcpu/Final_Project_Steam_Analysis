### Project Overview:
This project is a continuation of our previous project (https://github.com/SarahZ22/Project_2_Data_Visualization) ...

This project focuses on analyzing data from Steam, a cloud-based gaming library that allows users the ability to use any computer to access their content.

For this project our team wanted to utilize Machine Learning to predict whether games will be a hit or not based off the game's metacore and price. 
We also wanted to utilize Tableau to different game ownership trends.

Game hit was defined as when a game had a game ownership over the median of game ownership.
